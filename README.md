TODO - add my youtube playlist

## TypeScript and Deno

I've chosen these because they're solid tools, but I don't understand them as deeply as I'd like.

## Contributing

If you see a way I can use them better, *please make a PR*.

However, if you're coming from the videos, check the current code first - I'm not able to update YouTube videos, but I might have updated the code based on other's suggestions.
